# Implementation of Neural Networks Projects

WordRecognition - NN which recognizes only some list of words, disregards any other words. 

Tiles - NN reconstruction of original image tile by tile. Task is to approximate image as much as possible along with maximizing net profit.

LineArt - NN which converts images into ASCII art.

PatternRecognition - Solving a Pattern Recognition Problem with a Neural Network Script generated by Neural Pattern Recognition app
